This file contains MATLAB executable code, SLA data for the year 2023, the approach used for the assignment, and the result file.

### Altimeter_2023.mat

 The Altimeter_2023.mat file contains Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) data for the East Sea in 2023. This file is used to perform the analysis in the main logic.

### altimeterr_plot.m

 This is the code containing the main logic. It detects eddies in the East Sea from January 1, 2023, for a total of 5 days, draws the boundaries, and generates visualizations for the data over the 5-day period.
