### What is SLA (Sea Level Anomaly)?

 Sea level anomaly reveals the regional extent of anomalous water levels in the coastal ocean which can indicate unusual water temperatures, salinities, average monthly winds, atmospheric pressures or coastal currents.


## What is Eddy ?

 The ocean is a huge body of water that is constantly in motion. General patterns of ocean flow are called currents. Sometimes theses currents can pinch off sections and create circular currents of water called an eddy.


## How can we detect eddy using SLA?

 Eddies can be broadly categorized into two types as follows.

1. Warm Eddy
2. Cold Eddy

 First, Warm Eddies are eddies formed as a result of counterclockwise ocean currents, driven by the c
