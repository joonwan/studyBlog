### What is SLA (Sea Level Anomaly)?

 Sea level anomaly reveals the regional extent of anomalous water levels in the coastal ocean which can indicate unusual water temperatures, salinities, average monthly winds, atmospheric pressures or coastal currents.


## What is Eddy ?

 The ocean is a huge body of water that is constantly in motion. General patterns of ocean flow are called currents. Sometimes theses currents can pinch off sections and create circular currents of water called an eddy.


## How can we detect eddy using SLA?

 Eddies can be broadly categorized into two types as follows.

1. Warm Eddy
2. Cold Eddy

  First, Warm Eddies are eddies formed as a result of  clockwise ocean currents, driven by the currents, driven by the Coriolis force. Due to the influence of the Coriolis force, water is pushed toward the center of the eddy. As a result, sea level in the vicinity of Warm Eddies appears higher than the average.
  
  On the other hand, Cold Eddies rotate counterclockwise, causing water to move away from the center of the eddy due to the Coriolis force. This leads to lower sea levels measured in the vicinity of Cold Eddies compared to the surrounding area.

 So, let's use SLA data, which represents height differences, to identify Eddies!!.
